gametoolbox is a Python module for making simple 2D games.

What gametoolbox IS intended to be:
a portfolio-building/learning project for me (jbbranch9)
a framework for making (mostly) 2D grid-based games (which will be showcased in my portfolio along with this module)
an engine with simple, GUI-object-based player input controls (also supports basic mouse and keyboard inputs)
a way to keep code DRY (2D grid-based games all tend to use similar architecture)

What gametoolbox IS NOT intended to be:
a general-purpose game engine
used for commercial game production
capable of high-quality graphics (it's mostly going to be pre-rendered 2D bitmaps and ASCII/Unicode art)

DO NOT TRY TO REINVENT UNITY, UNREAL, GODOT, OR ANY OTHER GAME ENGINE!
(remember that I am building a portfolio here, not a product)

Undecided design questions:
Will it support realtime gameplay? Or will it only support sequential/turn-based gameplay?
Will it support non-rectangular grid patterns, such as isometric or hexagonal?
To what extent will it support audio effects and music?
To what extent will it support animation and visual effects?
    (it should probably be limited to stationary, animated GIFs, if animation is supported at all)


Planned games:

    easy:
connect-4
tic-tac-toe
word search

    intermediate:
chess
checkers
minesweeper
mazes
flippy
bricklayer

    hard:
sudoku
crossword
go
gomoku

    stretch-goal games:
tetris (if realtime play supported)
sokobox
manok (if non-square grids supported)
